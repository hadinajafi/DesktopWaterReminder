Using System trayIcon for staying the App open in background and showing notifications periodically.

TrayIcon package: java.awt.TrayIcon;
System tray: java.awt.SystemTray;
Image for show in tray: java.awt.Image;

first of all we check if the system supports tray or not.
after, we create image, trayIcon, and systemTray objects. system tray can have ToolTip also.
next step is adding trayIcon to systemTray and then displaying message with trayIcon.
